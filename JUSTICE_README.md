### GitHub Actions Pipeline

The automated pipeline performs:

1. **Text Extraction**: Uses pdfplumber to extract text from PDF documents
2. **Content Analysis**: Identifies children's names and relevant laws
3. **Document Classification**: Categorizes as Primary, Supporting, External, or No
4. **Packet Generation**: Creates oversight-ready packets with cover sheets
5. **Data Export**: Generates CSV files and printable indexes
