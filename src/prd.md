**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between titles, body text, and metadata
**Font Personality**: Modern, legible, and professional - suitable for legal documentation
**Readability Focus**: Generous line spacing and appropriate font sizes for document review tasks
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent sizing and spacing throughout the interface
**Which fonts**: Inter (Google Fonts) - excellent for professional applications
**Legibility Check**: Inter is highly legible across all screen sizes and weights

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout

**Attention Direction**: Clear visual flow from upload → processing → review → action
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to reduce cognitive load during document review
**Grid System**: Consistent card-based layout for document organization
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design that adapts gracefully to desktop workflows
**Content Density**: Balanced density that shows necessary information without overwhelming

### Animations

**Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle animations communicate processing status and guide attention to important state changes
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Progress indicators and status changes receive animation priority
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Professional, subtle animations that enhance rather than distract from serious work

### UI Elements & Component Selection

**Component Usage**: 
- Cards for document organization and information display
- Tabs for workflow separation (upload vs. review)
- Dialogs for detailed document examination
- Progress bars for processing feedback

**Component Customization**: Professional styling with consistent radius and spacing
**Component States**: Clear hover, focus, and active states for all interactive elements
**Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for consistency - legal scales, documents, shields
**Component Hierarchy**: Primary actions (upload, export) are visually prominent
**Spacing System**: Consistent padding using Tailwind's spacing scale
**Mobile Adaptation**: Cards stack vertically, dialogs adapt to screen size

### Visual Consistency Framework

**Design System Approach**: Component-based design with consistent styling patterns
