## Design Direction
The interface should feel authoritative and trustworthy - like professional legal software used by law firms and government agencies. Clean, structured layouts with clear information hierarchy emphasize the serious nature of the work while maintaining approachability for non-technical users.

## Color Selection
**Complementary** (professional blue and warm accent)
The design uses a sophisticated blue-based palette that conveys trust and professionalism while warm accents maintain approachability and readability.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Professional Blue (oklch(0.35 0.15 250)) - conveys authority and trustworthiness
- **Secondary Colors**: Light blues and grays for supporting elements and backgrounds
- **Accent Color**: Warm Orange (oklch(0.65 0.15 50)) - draws attention to important actions and status indicators
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (Pure White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Text (oklch(0.15 0 0)) - Ratio 19.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.35 0.15 250)): White Text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Light Blue oklch(0.95 0.05 250)): Dark Text (oklch(0.15 0 0)) - Ratio 17.1:1 ✓
  - Accent (Warm Orange oklch(0.65 0.15 50)): White Text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography should project competence and clarity - similar to legal briefs and government documents while remaining readable on screens.

  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing

  - Captions: Inter Regular/14px/muted color

## Animations
Subtle, purposeful animations that enhance professionalism rather than distract from serious content - emphasizing state changes and guiding attention to important updates.

- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Document upload progress, status changes, and critical alerts receive animation priority
