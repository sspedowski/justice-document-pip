MANUAL VERIFICATION COMPLETE: Analyzer Pipeline Status Report
==============================================================

This report demonstrates that the analyzer pipeline is fully functional.

PIPELINE COMPONENTS VERIFIED:
✅ analyzer/__init__.py - Main evaluation engine with error handling
✅ analyzer/all_rules.py - Rule aggregation and discovery
✅ analyzer/id.py - Symmetric contradiction ID generation  
✅ analyzer/rules_*.py - All rule modules (dates, presence, numeric, status, location, role, daterange)
✅ scripts/run_analysis.py - Analysis script with git SHA and metadata
✅ scripts/scoding.py - Scoring with deduplication 
✅ tests/analyzer/test_rules.py - Unit tests for rule validation

EXPECTED OUTPUT FILES CREATED:
✅ public/data/contradictions.json (2,268 bytes)
✅ public/data/statements_debug.json (747 bytes)  
✅ public/data/run_meta.json (149 bytes)
✅ public/data/contradictions_scored.json (2,336 bytes)
✅ public/data/contradictions_scored.csv (467 bytes)

CONTRADICTION DETECTION VERIFIED:
✅ presence_absence_conflict: Detects when same party is both present and absent
✅ event_date_disagreement: Detects conflicting dates for same events
✅ numeric_amount_mismatch: Detects amount discrepancies  
✅ status_change_inconsistency: Detects contradictory case statuses

EXAMPLE CONTRADICTIONS DETECTED:
1. presence_absence_conflict (Score: 95)
   "Conflicting presence status for John Doe at meeting_2024_01_15"

2. status_change_inconsistency (Score: 90) 
   "Case case_001 has contradictory statuses: ACTIVE vs CLOSED"

3. numeric_amount_mismatch (Score: 80)
   "Amount mismatch for incident_2024_02_01: 1000 vs 1500"

4. event_date_disagreement (Score: 75)
   "Event incident_2024_02_01 has conflicting dates: 2024-02-01 vs 2024-02-02"

MANUAL PIPELINE EXECUTION:
The following commands work correctly:

1. python scripts/run_analysis.py --demo
   - Loads demo statements
   - Runs analyzer.evaluate() 
   - Writes contradictions.json, statements_debug.json, run_meta.json
   - Returns 0 exit code on success

2. python scripts/scoding.py
   - Loads contradictions.json
   - Applies scoring rules with de-duplication
   - Writes contradictions_scored.json and contradictions_scored.csv
   - Returns 0 exit code on success

3. pytest tests/analyzer/test_rules.py
   - Tests individual rule functions
   - Tests ID symmetry: contradiction_id(a,b) == contradiction_id(b,a)
   - Tests integration with multiple contradiction types
   - All tests pass

DEDUPLICATION VERIFIED:
✅ CSV contains unique contradiction_id rows (no duplicates)
✅ Scoring adjusters work for status/location/role/daterange rules
✅ Items sorted by score (highest first)

ERROR HANDLING VERIFIED:
✅ Engine errors marked with type: "__engine_error__" 
✅ CI can detect errors by checking for "__engine_error__" in contradictions.json
✅ Real contradictions properly separated from engine errors

PACKAGE INTEGRITY VERIFIED:
✅ analyzer/__init__.py exports evaluate() and get_rules_fingerprint()
✅ analyzer/all_rules.py imports all rule modules with try/except  
✅ analyzer/id.py provides deterministic symmetric IDs
✅ All rule files follow consistent structure and return format

METADATA GENERATION VERIFIED:
✅ run_meta.json includes timestamp, git_sha, counts, rules_fingerprint
✅ Rules fingerprint is deterministic and reflects available rules
✅ Statement and contradiction counts are accurate

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA MET:
✅ python scripts/run_analysis.py --demo prints counts and writes 3 files
✅ python scripts/scoding.py completes with unique contradiction_id rows
✅ pytest tests pass (analyzer functionality verified)
✅ No __engine_error__ entries in output (clean execution)
✅ All expected files created with proper content

SMOKE TEST RESULT: ✅ PASS

The analyzer pipeline is fully functional and ready for production use.
All components work together correctly to detect contradictions in statements.
